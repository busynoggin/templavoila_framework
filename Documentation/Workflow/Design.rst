Visual Design
================================

Once the information architecture is complete, it is time to work on the visual design. This is simply creating static visual designs of what various pages in a site should look like.

Most designers use Adobe Photoshop, Fireworks or Illustrator for this process. Don't worry about which is better. Use whatever program you know the best.

It is not necessary to work up a visual design on every page. Just do a mockup on each different page layout. Often this is simply a home page and a couple of interior page variations.

**Design considerations for the web**

Any medium has technical issues of which designers must be aware. For print you think about dot gain. For video you have to be aware about screen proportions and safe area. Web is no different. Here is what you need to consider when designing for the web.

- Flexibility, your site will be accessed by a variety of computers, monitors, browsers, smart phones, assistive technologies and connection speeds. Design accordingly. Your designer must understand that no other users will be viewing the site on his eight-core MacPro with dual 30" monitors. And yes, I am jealous.
- Pay particular attention to the width of your design so the smaller monitors can see your site. Generally a page width of 930 to 980 pixels is considered the basic depending on the edge treatment. Of course, with responsive and adaptive design you may have to design different looks for different sizes.
- Watch your fonts. If you plan to use any but the few fonts common across platforms make sure you know how you will handle that in code.
- Design in an RGB color space not CMYK.
- Finally, if your designer has little or no experience designing for the web, get a new designer. If fact, if you needed to be told to design in RGB then please get another designer.

Having said all this, web design is not as limiting as some designers (and coders) would lead you to believe. Those who think so are way behind the times.
