Overview of the Workflow
================================

As fascinating as the technical capabilities may be of TYPO3, TemplaVoila and even this templating framework, they mean little unless you can harness them to build sites. After all, the ultimate goal of all this is to build powerful, effective web sites and to build them quickly.

In order to do this well, you must have a workflow. A workflow is simply the sequence of steps needed to move from an initial idea to a completed website.

The following is the workflow we use at Busy Noggin to produce TYPO3-driven websites utilitzing this the TemplaVoila Framework. Each step is explained in more detail on pages in this section.

- Determine the information architecture for the site
- Wireframing
- Setup a TYPO3 install including the TemplaVoila Framework and Busy Noggin Wireframe skin
- Develop a working prototype.
- Work up the visual design mockups.
- Visualize the HTML structure and choose the page templates.
- Integrate the visual design into TYPO3 by creating a template skin.
    - Code the page design into the Busy Noggin static HTML starter files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
    - Write the skin based on the static HTML starters
- Code any special functionality with custom content elements or extensions
- Load the content and launch the site.
