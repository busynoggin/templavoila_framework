Building the Skin
================================

Building the skin is where you deal deeply with the TemplaVoila Framework. Once you understand how to build a skin process we outline below can be modifed to fit your situation.

Transforming a design from a Photoshop or Fireworks file into TYPO3 takes skills in front-end coding (HTML, CSS and JavaScript), in TYPO3 templating and in TypoScript.

Because of the TemplaVoila Framework our internal starter package, at Busy Noggin we currently spent most of the integration time on front-end coding not on the TYPO3 templating and TypoScript since the Framework streamlines so much of that. When we do spend time on the latter, it is generally for programming custom content elements and  for handling special situations unique to the site.
