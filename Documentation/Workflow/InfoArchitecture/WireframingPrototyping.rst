Wireframing
================================

Creating wireframes can be helpful in the early planning stages and can take the form of quick hand sketches or more polished pieces created with software.

Software you might want to take a look at are:

- Balsamiq Mockups
- OmniGraffle

================================
Prototyping
================================

Having a set of paper wireframes is a good idea and having a workable clickable HTML wireframe prototype is a great idea, but having a working, clickable wireframe driven by TYPO3 is a fantastic idea. Here's why.

- Organizational concepts can be explored and tested just like they will be on the final site. Pages are discovered by clicking on links and menus.
- User experience testing can begin immediately.
- Content and pages can be easily moved around and tested as the information architect experiments with different organizational schemes.
- The client can be trained immediately on content entry and can even enter permanent site content. After all, the pages in the wireframe will be the actual pages in the finished site but simply skinned with the final design.
-	Extension configruration and programming can start before the final design is completed.

Just before prototyping, we set up a TYPO3 installation with the TemplaVoila Framework and the Busy Noggin Wireframe skin. With that we have all we need to build a fully-functional prototype.

**Fast tracking workflow**

Although the workflow is presented in sequential steps, it is possible to fast track the process by working some steps concurrently.

Once the infomation archtecture is nailed down and replicated in the working prototype, the following three steps can actually begin at the same time.

- The graphic desiginer can mockup the visual design.
- The programmer can begin installing extensions, setting up users, etc.
- The content editor can begin entering content. Initially the content will be presented in the wireframe but will automatically be reformatted when the final skin is integrated.
