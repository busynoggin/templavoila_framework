Information Architecture
================================

As sites become larger and are expected to provide more to the user, properly planning the information architecture (IA) of the site is crucial. Poorly conceived IA costs time and money throughout the entire development process because it triggers needless redesigns and code rewrites.

You can go as deep and detailed as you wish, but at a minimum develop a site outline and list of features.

The graphic desiginer can mockup the visual design.
The programmer can begin installing extensions, setting up users, etc.
The content editor can begin entering content. Initially the content will be presented in the wireframe but will automatically be reformatted when the final skin is integrated.
