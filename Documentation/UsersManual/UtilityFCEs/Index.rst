================================
Utility FCEs
================================

Those familiar with TemplaVoila understand that its real power is in allowing the developer to program Flexible Content Elements (FCEs) to handle a variety of special formatting and processing needs.

The TemplaVoila Framework provides a system of Utility FCEs that handle a variety of common formatting situations that arise on sites, but that are not taken care of by standard content elements.

These situations include breaking content areas into columns and modules as well as wrapping content in custom HTML for individual CSS styling.

Of course, the developer still has all the power of TemplaVoilia to create new FCEs to handle unique needs.
