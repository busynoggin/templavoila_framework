HTML Wrapper
================================

The HTML Wrapper is used when you want to put custom HTML before and after content. It is commonly used to wrap content with special formatting that is only used once in the site.

The same can be accomplished by using the standard TYPO3 HTML element twice (once before and once after the content). However, this HTML Wrapper makes it easier for the back end editor to know where to put content.
