================================
Standardization
================================

You will never be able to design sites quickly and with consistent quality unless you standardize your approach and your code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypoScript, data structures, and template objects).

However, standardization does not have to mean bland, limited visual design. Two websites can have radically different visual designs and yet be based on standardized code. See `CSS Zen Garden <http://www.csszengarden.com/>`_ as an example of what can be done visually to identical HTML code with just CSS.

**Easier Maintenance**

Standardizing code and approach also means that you know exactly where to go when enhancing a site that you completed long ago.
